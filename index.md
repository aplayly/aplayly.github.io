# About
I'm a second-year Computer Science Master student at The Ohio State University working under [Prof. Wei-Lun Chao][wei-lun-chao]. I received my Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication Engineering at [Bandung Institute of Technology][itb] in 2019.

I'm currently working on open world machine learning and out-of-distribution detection research problems. My broader interest is in applicable and reliable machine learning for the community.
