**Open for job market starting August 2023, feel free to reach out to me!**

I am a Computer Science Master Student from The Ohio State University. I received my Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication Engineering at [Bandung Institute of Technology][itb] in 2019. I am grateful to work under [Prof. Wei-Lun Chao][wei-lun-chao] and [Prof. Joko Suryana][joko-suryana] for my master's and bachelor's theses. I am also grateful to work for [Prof. Trio Adiono][trio-adiono] during my post-undergraduate.

I am currently working on open world machine learning and out-of-distribution detection research problems. My broader interest is in deploying applicable and reliable machine learning models for the community.
