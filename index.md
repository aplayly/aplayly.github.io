# About

I'm a second-year Computer Science Master student at The Ohio State University working under [Prof. Wei-Lun Chao][wei-lun-chao]. I got my Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication Engineering at [Bandung Institute of Technology][itb].

My research interest includes robustness and out-of-distribution in machine learning.
